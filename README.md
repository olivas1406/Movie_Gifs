***

This is a dynamic webpage that will display 10 gifs and their ratings when a labelled button is pressed.  
There will also be an input field
on the right-hand side that allows you to dynamically add a button to the top of the 
page to generate gifs.  This project will be useful 
for entertaining children (or a child-like adult) for short periods 
of time.  To get started, simply click one of the predefined buttons at the top of the page or enter a term into the 
input field to generate a new button.
